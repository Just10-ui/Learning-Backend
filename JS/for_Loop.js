/*
  * For Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
  * For Loops are fundamental for tasks like performing an action multiple times.
*/

/* 
  * The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
  - for (exp 1; exp 2; exp 3) {
    // code block to be executed
  - }

  - exp 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
  - exp 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
  - exp 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

// example of using for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // code to be executed
